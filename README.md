# mysql-test
I'm trying to make mySQL data show up in HTML
I can already get it to show up in localhost using the listen command and importing a mysql module and a node.js module.
I still need to do node.js or use nodemon in terminal, but that is just fine for me.
I just wanted to get it embedded in the HTML I created.
The program is a demo version of a scouts troop status program that is open to the scouts.
